# FastAPI Async Boilerplate

This repository provides a boilerplate for building an asynchronous FastAPI application. It includes configurations for development tools like `pytest`, `pylint`, `isort`, and `black` to streamline the development workflow, ensure code quality, and maintain consistent coding standards.

## Features

- **FastAPI**: An async web framework for building fast APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Async Ready**: The app is structured to use asynchronous endpoints, making it suitable for high-concurrency applications.
- **Testing with pytest**: `pytest` is pre-configured for running unit and integration tests, ensuring smooth testing workflows.
- **Code Formatting with black**: `black`, the uncompromising code formatter, is integrated for automatic code formatting.
- **Import Sorting with isort**: `isort` is configured to automatically sort imports based on standard conventions.
- **Code Linting with pylint**: `pylint` is set up for static analysis, ensuring that the codebase adheres to best practices and style guidelines.
